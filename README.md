### Forward Selection Trace:

Enter the total number of features: 4<br />
<br />
<br />
Type the number of the algorithm you want to run:<br />
(1) Forward Selection<br />
(2) Backward Selection<br />
(3) Group Special Algorithm<br />
<br />
1<br />
Forward Selection:<br />
Using no features and 'random' evaluation, I get an accuracy of 37.9583%<br />
Beginning search.<br />
<br />
Using feature(s) {1} accuracy is 84.2917%<br />
Using feature(s) {2} accuracy is 71.6848%<br />
Using feature(s) {3} accuracy is 65.5623%<br />
Using feature(s) {4} accuracy is 83.9476%<br />
Feature set {1} was best, accuracy is 84.2917%<br />
<br />
Using feature(s) {1,2} accuracy is 36.4699%<br />
Using feature(s) {1,3} accuracy is 80.6486%<br />
Using feature(s) {1,4} accuracy is 35.6107%<br />
Feature set {1,3} was best, accuracy is 80.6486%<br />
<br />
Using feature(s) {1,2,3} accuracy is 57.7928%<br />
Using feature(s) {1,3,4} accuracy is 14.7599%<br />
Feature set {1,2,3} was best, accuracy is 57.7928%<br />
<br />
Using feature(s) {1,2,3,4} accuracy is 80.6055%<br />
Feature set {1,2,3,4} was best, accuracy is 80.6055%<br />
<br />
Finished forward selection!! The best feature subset is {1}, which has an accuracy of 84.2917%<br />
