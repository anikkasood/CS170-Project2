### Forward Selection Trace:

Enter the total number of features: 4


Type the number of the algorithm you want to run:
(1) Forward Selection
(2) Backward Selection
(3) Group Special Algorithm

1
Forward Selection:
Using no features and 'random' evaluation, I get an accuracy of 37.9583%
Beginning search.

Using feature(s) {1} accuracy is 84.2917%
Using feature(s) {2} accuracy is 71.6848%
Using feature(s) {3} accuracy is 65.5623%
Using feature(s) {4} accuracy is 83.9476%
Feature set {1} was best, accuracy is 84.2917%

Using feature(s) {1,2} accuracy is 36.4699%
Using feature(s) {1,3} accuracy is 80.6486%
Using feature(s) {1,4} accuracy is 35.6107%
Feature set {1,3} was best, accuracy is 80.6486%

Using feature(s) {1,2,3} accuracy is 57.7928%
Using feature(s) {1,3,4} accuracy is 14.7599%
Feature set {1,2,3} was best, accuracy is 57.7928%

Using feature(s) {1,2,3,4} accuracy is 80.6055%
Feature set {1,2,3,4} was best, accuracy is 80.6055%

Finished forward selection!! The best feature subset is {1}, which has an accuracy of 84.2917%
